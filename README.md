# DMC Swatch Bobbins

Step 1: Print 500 of the bobbins (dmc-swatch-bobbin.stl) on the 3d printer of your choosing. I had the best luck prining them on their sides (long narrow side to the bed), with supports underneath.

Step 2: Glue a magnet into each one. The wells on the back are sized for 1/4" x 1/8" x 1/32" thick magnets. I got mine from [KJ Magnetics](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=B4201)
