# DMC Swatch Bobbins

Step 1: Print 500 of the bobbins (dmc-swatch-bobbin.stl) on the 3d printer of your choosing. I had the best luck prining them on their sides (long narrow side to the bed), with supports underneath.

Step 2: Glue a magnet into each one.
- The wells on the back of the original are sized for 1/4" x 1/8" x 1/32" thick magnets. I got mine from [KJ Magnetics](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=B4201). 
- The round well version is sized to take 6 x 2 mm magnets. These can be found rather inexpensively on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ71S57Y).

Step 3: Print labels. If you have a Silhouette Cameo machine you can use the included labels-all.studio3 file, making sure to print each page with registration marks on and the 'cut lines' layer off. 

Step 4: Wind each bobbin with floss. Secure with a dab of superglue and trim excess thread.

Step 5: Apply label and enjoy!
- If you don't have access to a Silhouette Cameo machine, you can use Avery Return Address Labels 18294 (⅔" x 1 ¾") cut into 4. Each quarter label fits almost perfectly in the label space of the bobbins. They can then be labeled by hand with a permanent marker.
